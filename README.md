# Weapon Recoil & Fire Rate Selection
Realistic FiveM Weapon Recoil and Fire Rate Selection UI

# Showcase Video:

# Features:
- UI show based on if the Weapon is Semi and Fully automatic
- Press left ALT to click the UI buttons
- If Statements can be uncommented to add gun specific values
- Uncomment "IsControlPressed" part and delete these lines in StopWeaponSwitching() if you want to switch weapon without manually pressing the SAFE ui button
- The weapon wheel, rolling and tab keyboard button are disabled when SAFE is not selected
- Automatically switches to SAFE when going into the water and getting in a vehicle to stop switching to the wrong UI with the wrong gun (May be fixable but this is how it is for now)

# Issues:
- Minigun and WidowMaker run out of ammo (Unresolvable as far as I can work out)
- Guns keep on bullet to stop weapon switching and the UI breaking (May be fixable but this is how it is for now)
- Recoil in a vehicle in first person can't recoil upwards (Unresolvable as far as I can work out)

# Bugs: None Known
